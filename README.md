# FormTableGenerator
This is the UI desktop application aimed at creating tables with DAC digital values

##TODO
1. Set resolution value. For exapmle: 12 bit, then maximum digital value = 0xFFF
2. Set samples qty. Consider that the more samples the more ideal form you will get,
but then you also have to use timer with higher frequency to get the same frequency of the signal:
`Signal freq = timer freq/samples`
